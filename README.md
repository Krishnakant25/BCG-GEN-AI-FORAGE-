# **BCGX Generative AI Virtual Job Simulation**

This repository contains my completed work for the BCGX Generative AI Virtual Job Simulation, hosted on The Forage platform. It includes all the deliverables and resources used to complete the tasks, showcasing my practical skills in applying generative AI to solve business challenges.



#### üìÅ Repository Contents

The project is structured into folders, with each one dedicated to a specific task of the simulation.



Task 1: Data Extraction and Initial Analysis

01\_Data\_Extraction\_and\_Analysis/: Contains the Jupyter Notebook and other files used for the initial data processing and exploratory analysis.



Task 2: Developing an AI-Driven Financial Chatbot Prototype

02\_Financial\_Chatbot\_Prototype/: Houses the Python application for the chatbot prototype, including the main scripts and testing files.



Certificate of Completion

certificate/: Includes the official certificate of completion for the virtual job simulation.



#### üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the project files, follow these steps:



Clone the repository:



Bash



git clone https://github.com/ADVAIT135/Forage\_BCGX\_Gen\_AI\_Virtual\_Job\_Simulation.git

cd Forage\_BCGX\_Gen\_AI\_Virtual\_Job\_Simulation

Open the relevant task folder.



Launch the Jupyter Notebook from within the task folder:



Bash



jupyter notebook

Follow the instructions provided within each notebook.



#### üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

This project uses Python 3.x. All necessary dependencies can be installed by running the following command in your terminal:



Bash



pip install -r requirements.txt

If the requirements.txt file is not present, you can install the main packages manually: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, openpyxl, and others as specified at the beginning of each notebook.



#### üôè Acknowledgements
